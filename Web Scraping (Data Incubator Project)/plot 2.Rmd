The second graph is about comparing champions attack and defense ability. For defens ability, I added 
armor and magic resist up. For attack, I used attack damage and attack speed.

```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
data <- read.csv('champions.csv')
library(lattice)
library(plyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(Rmisc)

# Health vs. Mana
c = qplot(data$Attack_dmg, data$Armor+data$Magic_Resist,xlab='Attack Damage',ylab='Armor & Magic Resist',main='Level1: Attack Damage vs. Armor')
d = qplot(data$Attack_spd, data$Armor+data$Magic_Resist,xlab='Attack Speed',ylab='Armor & Magic Resist', main='Level1: Attack Speed vs. Armor')
data$Max_Attack_dmg = data$Attack_dmg + data$Attack_dmg.level * 17
data$Max_Attack_spd = data$Attack_spd * (1 + data$Attack_spd.level_percent * 17)
data$Max_Armor = data$Armor + data$Armor.level * 17
data$Max_Magic_Resist = data$Magic_Resist + data$Magic_Resist.level * 17
e = qplot(data$Max_Attack_dmg, data$Max_Armor+data$Max_Magic_Resist,xlab='Attack Damage',ylab='Armor & Magic Resist',main='Level18: Attack Damage vs. Armor')
f = qplot(data$Max_Attack_spd, data$Max_Armor+data$Max_Magic_Resist,xlab='Attack Speed',ylab='Armor & Magic Resist',main='Level18: Attack Speed vs. Armor')
multiplot(c,d,e,f, cols=2)
```

- For attack damage, we can see some positive correlation between attack and defense. When level is max, the
correlation is stronger.
- For attack speed, there's no obvious correlation. When level is max, the correlation is not obvious. But there
are two outliers, which seems interesting. We can explore more in the future.
